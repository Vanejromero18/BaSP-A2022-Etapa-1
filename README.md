## Week 02
This week every team member has to recreate the Landing Desktop made, by Freire and Ibaceta, the last week on Figma. The Landing Desktop´s recreation has to be in html.
Every team member has to use some essential tools such as Git, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub, and made a repository on GitHub.
