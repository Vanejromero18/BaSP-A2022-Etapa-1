## Week 00 - FIGMA
The team and I made the ScreenFlow of Trackgenix´s page on Figma. We divided the work between different teams and everyone made a part of the web. 
Carro and Guglielmone made the SuperAdmin functionalities part, Stabile and Ivanff made the Admin part, Vescoco and Pimentel made the Employee PM part, Viso and I made the Employee part, Freire and Ibaceta made the Landing Desktop, and Hojberg and Cappuccio made the Landing Mobile.

## Week 01 - HTML
This week every team member has to recreate the Landing Desktop made, by Freire and Ibaceta, the last week on Figma. The Landing Desktop´s recreation has to be in html.
Every team member has to use some essential tools such as Git, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub, and made a repository on GitHub.

## Week 02 - CSS
This week, continuing with last week's work, we will include style in the HTML that we made. The week´s goal is to make the page display look identical to the Landing page that we can see on FIGMA´s screenflow. 
***
## Week 03 - Flexbox
This third week we start with a new topic: Flexbox. This time we will recreat the Landing for three different devices: Mobile, Tablet and Desktop, and for be able to do it we will use Flexbox, a CSS´s tool. This tool is great for making flexible designs that adapt to any device.
